# Velocity Limits
In finance, it's common for accounts to have so-called "velocity limits". So this is a Golang application that accepts or declines attempts to load funds into customers' accounts in real-time.

Each attempt to load funds will come as a single-line JSON payload, structured as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "1234",
  "customer_id": "1234",
  "load_amount": "$123.45",
  "time": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Each customer is subject to three limits:

- A maximum of $5,000 can be loaded per day
- A maximum of $20,000 can be loaded per week
- A maximum of 3 loads can be performed per day, regardless of amount
 
As such, a user attempting to load $3,000 twice in one day would be declined on the second attempt, as would a user attempting to load $400 four times in a day.

For each load attempt, you should return a JSON response indicating whether the fund load was accepted based on the user's activity, with the structure:

```json
{ "id": "1234", "customer_id": "1234", "accepted": true }
```

You can assume that the input arrives in ascending chronological order and that if a load ID is observed more than once for a particular user, all but the first instance can be ignored. Each day is considered to end at midnight UTC, and weeks start on Monday (i.e. one second after 23:59:59 on Sunday).

This application process the lines from input.txt and return output2.txt, the expected output given the input data can be found in output.txt.
